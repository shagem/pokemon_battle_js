                <h3>Bulbasaur</h3>
                <p>Bulbasaur resembles a small amphibian/frog, but it bears three claws on each of its feet and has no tail. Bulbasaur tend to be very rare, as they are shy creatures that prefer the company of their own kind. However, they are also generally very docile, tame, and loyal to people that they trust.</p>

                <h3>Charmander</h3>
                <p>Charmander is a small, bipedal, dinosaur-like Pokémon. Most of its body is colored orange, while its underbelly is a pale light-yellow color. Charmander is easily the most mild-mannered and well-behaved of its evolution line. Its feelings and emotions can be read by the flame on the tip of its tail.</p>

                <p>Squirtle is a small, light-blue Pokémon with an appearance similar to a turtle. Squirtle is usually well behaved, yet it has an underlying rebellious streak. It likes to be open with only a limited number of people and won't advertise its secrets.</p>
